<a name="school"></a><h3>All About School</h3>
	<ul class="school">
		<li><strong>School:</strong> Illinois Institute of Technology</li>
		<li><strong>Degree:</strong> Bachelors of Science, Mechanical Engineering</li>
		<li><strong>Year: </strong> Second </li>
		<li><strong> GPA: </strong> 3.75 </li>
	</ul>
	<p> That's right ladies and gents, I go to good ole Illinois Tech. We are a bunch of nerds, and we, or at least I, like it that way. </p>
<a name="sports"></a><h3>All About Sports</h3>
	<p> This sports section should really just be called 'All About Soccer', because it's the only sport that has ever really mattered to me. I truly wish I could say that it is the only physical activity I have ever participated in, but in my heart of hearts I know it isn't true. </p>
	<p>The first sport I ever'played' was gymnastics. I don't even remember it, but I've got one very tiny participation medal and the pictures and  to prove it. I don't really know why I stopped gymnastics, but I do know my next great attempt at athleticism was in dance. I had one class and couldn't do a summersault. Looking back, while the reason I didn't go back to dance class was that I was mortified, the reason my mom chose to pull me out of gymnastics is probably burried somewhere in there too. I went through two seasons of kiddie poms for the Calvert Bucaneers. I finally found soccer in the first grade and I have been playing ever since. </p>
	<p> I wasn't a stand out player from the start. You know what I'm talking about, those child prodigies that touch a ball for the first time and can juggle like Ron Aldino. I would say that my skill didn't really start to develop until the third grade. My team, I believe our name was the mustangs (a lot of my recreational teams where named 'the mustangs' for some reason), was scrimmaging another team (whose name I don't recall). I was playing center mid-field, which would eventually become my prefered spot, when I got the ball. At this point in my carreer I still looked at the ball while I was dribbling. There are tons of issues with this, the biggest being that you can't see when another person is coming at you. What you can see when you are looking down at the ball, is your feet, the ball, and a small area of ground probably proportional to your height and peripheral vision. Should someone elses feet enter this area, you can see them too! This is what I relied on during the third grade a queue that it was time to pass the ball.  </p>
	<p> Well, as I said, I was playing center-mid when I got the ball. Someone's feet entered my 'area' and I tried to pass the ball to my teammate (who I assumed was up the field, I wouldn't know because I was looking down). It was a horrible attempt and the ball got maybe a two feet away from me, but it did get past my opponent. While I am not very fast, I had the advantage because I was facing the ball and I easily beat the other girl to it. I didn't know it but I had just executed my first 'cut'. I was smart enough at this time to reaize that my fluke had worked out beautifully and did it all the way down the field. Every time someone's feet entered my periphery I just cut the ball past them. </p>
	<p> I got all the way to the end of the field and shot. I missed the goal of course (because I was still looking down), but I had just dribbled past 6 other girls. It was truly exciting, and it was the first time I felt proud of anything I had done in concern to athletics. I was hooked. </p>
	<p>I have been playing soccer ever since. I play year round. I played for my high school and now I play for my college. </p>
